# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


Using the code we updated the html and created a javascript.  We added grid containers for a normal business day from 9-5 and have allowed the editing of each grid and a save button. By using JQuery, Bootstrap and Moment.js, we're able to create a more accessible user experience and pull the knowledge that we have.  By using the above the scheduler was more interactive and shows past, present, and future items based on the clock and the time they are do. I have included pictures of the app, unforunately they were to big to add in the readme, so I placed them as a document above.
